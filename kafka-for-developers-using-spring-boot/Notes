==================
Consumer offsets are stored in an internal topic called __consumer_offset.

Basically, consumer offset indicates how many msgs are read from a partition in a topic.

Kafka message is written in a file in kafka. The location is mentioned by property
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs

Kafka logs are stored in /var/lib/kafka/data

cd /var/lib/kafka/data

ls

You will see 2 folders test-topic-0 and test-topic-1 as topic test-topic has 2 paritions.
Go inside test-topic-0

cd test-topic-0

you will see files like

0000000000.log
0000000000.timeindex
partitions.metadata
leader-epoch-checkpoint

Messages are persisted in log file.

Retention policy determins how much time message will be stored.
Default value is 168 hours (7 days).
Its configured using log.retention.hours which is inside server.properties.

This config file is present in
/etc/kafka/server.properties

cat /etc/kafka/server.properties

log.retention.policy=168
